        <p>
          John Muir was born on April 21rst 1838 in Dunbar, Scottland. In 1849
          he moved with his family to the United States. He had a younger
          brother, with whow he enjoyed exploring the fields and the woods of
          the rich Wiscounsin countryside. Im 1860, he entered the University of
          Wisconsin. Three years later, he started traveling around the world.
          In 1867 he suffered an eye injury that had a large impact on his life.
          After recovering, he decided he would dedicate his life to the fields
          and woods. In March 1868 he landed in San Francisco and from that
          moment on California became his Home. He became truly attached to
          California's Sierra Nevada and Yosemite. In 1874 he launched a
          successful career as a writer. In 1880 he got married to Louie Wanda
          Strentzel, with whom he had two daughters. Through a series of
          articles published in Century magazine, Muir brought the attention to
          the devastation of mountains and forests. In 1890, with the help of
          Century's associate editor - Robert Underwood Johnson - an act of
          Congress created Yosemite National Park. Muir was also involved in the
          creation of Sequoia, Mount Rainier and Grand Canyon National Parks.
          For that reason, Muir is often called the "The Father of the National
          Parks". In 1892, Muir and supporters found the "Sierra Club". Muir
          served as the Club's president until his death in 1914.

            "...It seemed to me the Sierra should be called no the Nevada, or
            Snowy Range, but the Range of Light...the most divinely beautiful of
            all the mountain chains I have ever seen."
